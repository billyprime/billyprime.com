I’ve been obsessed with [Aidan Hughes](http://bruteprop.co.uk/)' work since I saw my first [KMFDM](https://kmfdm.net/) album cover three decades ago. Today I was listening to ANGST and feeling inspired by the [LIGHT single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_(KMFDM_song)) cover. Featuring the always-fantastic [Shakti](/models/shakti/).

This was one of the first times I've played with the flexibility that comes with the SVG file format, you can **click the image below** to see the animated version using CSS transforms – it's not a video file!
