I haven't had much time for photography lately, and the pandemic has made artistic pursuits even more complicated.  I felt like I was getting into a rut, so I've started teaching myself to draw.  For my "finished" piece here, I chose one of my favorite [photos of River]({{ '/photos/nighthawks/' | relative_url }}) to recreate, while merging cyberpunk and Art Deco aesthetics with my own latex fetish style.

Just to make this extra challenging, I've also been switching off of Adobe's suite, as they continue to be more and more predatory in pricing and TOS, and have adopted the Affinity suite instead, using Designer for this vector drawing.  I've never really worked in vectors aside from some logo design, but the flexibility here for large-scale art is wonderful, and Designer's tools are very powerful for this sort of work.

Westward Bound made the latex leotard featured here, and [recently featured another photo from this set on their main website](https://www.westwardbound.com/european-union-and-international-orders-i372).
