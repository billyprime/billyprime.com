Another drawing attempt – [Mosh](https://www.instagram.com/officiallymosh/) referenced from a [photoshoot we did a when I was first starting out](http://localhost:8000/photos/mosh/).

I’m still exploring this new medium, this time blending various 20s styles such as Art Deco and Egyptian revival, while stealing Mucha’s hair technique and adding my own goth/witchy/cyber flair. I used some raster brushes to get a grungy background reminiscent of the concrete floor in the original photo.  This one was a lot of fun to work on, experimentings with various techniques.
